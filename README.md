# OpenAI gym Snake Environment

An environment that emulates the online multiplayer game of Slither.io

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. cd into gym-snakes and use pip install
'$ pip install -e .' NOTE: I would recommend installling this to a conda venv

## Common Problems
1. Make sure you did a full install on the gym package (MujoCo can be ignored)
2. If the gym-snakes import fails, make sure you have added the directory to PATH

## ToDo
1. Fix the collision checker that is called when snakes are created
