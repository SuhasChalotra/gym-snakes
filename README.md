## OpenAI gym Snake Environment

An environment that emulates the online multiplayer game of Slither.io

# Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. cd into gym-snakes and use pip install
'$ pip install -e .' NOTE: I would recommend installling this to a conda venv

# Common Problems
-Make sure you did a full install on the gym package (MujoCo can be ignored)
-If the gym-snakes import fails, make sure you have added the directory to PATH

# ToDo
1. Fix the collision checker that is called when snakes are created
